		Many people believe that a healthy lifestyle is a constant restriction and discomfort. In fact, there are many ways to be healthy without drastic changes in your life! Even if you follow them only partially, your health and mood will become much better.

How does lifestyle affect your health?
Many health problems require a certain lifestyle. Gastroenterologist patients understand why they can't eat fast food, and people with bronchial problems are more likely to quit Smoking after diagnosis. Unfortunately, many of our habits can make our existing illnesses worse. And if everyone knows about the dangers of fatty foods, alcohol or tobacco, then lack of sleep, constant stress or a sedentary lifestyle often seem to be minor problems.

Unbalanced food affects not only the gastrointestinal tract, but also the entire body: a lack of even one of the vitamins can lead to serious diseases. The harm of ethyl alcohol and nicotine to the human body has long been proven: they negatively affect the digestive, respiratory, circulatory and nervous systems. Lack of rest reduces the immune system, contributes to memory loss and distraction, and aggravates existing diseases.

On the contrary, people with confirmed diagnoses often only need to change their lifestyle, and their diseases will manifest much less. Often, to be healthy, you only need to eat a balanced diet, include a small amount of exercise in the fresh air, consume more fluids, sleep for 7-8 hours and avoid stress.

Healthy lifestyle: 20 habits and ways to be healthy
Healthy diet
Drink more water. An adult needs about 8 glasses of liquid a day. This amount includes all beverages and liquid products (such as soups). But it is better to replace strong tea and coffee with clean water. Try to learn to drink a glass of water immediately after waking up: this allows you to quickly Wake up yourself and "Wake up" the gastrointestinal tract.
Don't skip Breakfast. A rich and balanced meal in the morning will provide you with vigor and strength until lunch. Coffee and cake will not work: the best option is to combine cottage cheese or eggs, porridge and fruit.
Review your eating habits. Nutritionists advise you to make each meal this way: half a plate — fresh vegetables, a quarter — side dish (porridge or starchy vegetables), and another quarter — protein (meat, cottage cheese, eggs or fish). If possible, you should get rid of sugar and sauces to get used to the natural taste of food. Try to avoid sweets, fast food and snacks: at first it will be difficult, but in a week or a week and a half the craving for harmful products will be much reduced.
Eat on time. Try to stay at least two hours without food before going to bed. Distribute meals throughout the day so that there is no break for more than 3-4 hours. But at the first feeling of hunger, be sure to have a little snack: this will reduce the risk of overeating during a full lunch or dinner.

Sleep and rest
Arrange a sleeping place. The bed should be comfortable, and the mattress and pillows should be firm enough to support your back while you sleep. Ventilate the bedroom in the evening. If light and sounds from the street interfere, use a night eye mask and earplugs.
Don't save your sleep time. An adult needs to sleep at least 7-8 hours a day to be healthy. We can work hard for a while and stay awake for 20 hours, but in the end this will lead to problems and poor health.
Change your classes. The best rest is a change of activity. If the work is related to physical labor, then you should not immediately rush home for repairs and cleaning. Take a warm bath, turn on some music, and read a book. And if you spent eight hours at the computer, then in the evening you should take your mind off the screen: go for a walk, conduct a workout or prepare lunch for tomorrow.
Avoid stress if possible. This is communication with unpleasant people, uncomfortable work, problems in your personal life, failures in creativity or favorite activities. If it is impossible to get rid of the sources of stress, it is better to consult a specialist to learn how to respond correctly to stimuli.

Physical fitness support
Enter physical activity into your daily routine. Heavy training is not necessary at all: to be healthy, it is enough to walk at a brisk pace for half an hour. Gradually, you can start to abandon the elevators and get out two or three stops earlier. Activity in the morning will cheer you up, and a leisurely walk in the evening will improve your health and sleep.
In addition, you can add a little gymnastics to the day plan. For example, exercises to strengthen the back muscles.
Keep your weight within normal limits. If you have a clear lack or excess weight — try to fix it. Both have a negative impact on the health of the supporting and cardiovascular systems.
Healthy habit
Make up your daily routine. This will help you organize your time, work, and leisure. With a clear schedule, you will not sit up for business until late at night, you will not miss meals or sports, and you will stop forgetting about the necessary rest.
Conduct a warm-up session. The more often you get up, the better for your legs, back, and heart. It is best to walk a little and warm up every 20 minutes. But activity even once an hour will save you from fatigue and restore your performance.
Get rid of bad habits. This is difficult, and you may have to turn to professionals. But the improvement of health and well-being after giving up alcohol, tobacco and other harmful substances is worth all the effort.
Avoid unnecessary risks and follow safety procedures. It is not difficult to wear a helmet while riding a bike or wearing a seat belt in a car, but it will help to avoid serious damage.
Take care of hygiene. Wash your hands thoroughly before eating, after using the toilet, or outside. Take a shower daily and brush your teeth at least twice a day. These simple steps will save you from many infectious diseases.
Not hurry. There is no point in trying to acquire all these habits at once. It is better to start gradually, so that they do not cause tension and become firmly embedded in your life.
Medicine and validation of the body
Regularly undergo medical examinations. So you can notice diseases in time, when they are easiest to cure. It is best to do this at least once a year. If you do not have enough time to visit several doctors and pass tests all the time, complete a full examination in one visit to the clinic. Comprehensive diagnostics of Total Body Scan will take only three hours.
Don't ignore the discomfort. If you feel unwell, contact a doctor, do not wait for the moment when it becomes very bad. A non-specialist is unlikely to be able to determine the cause of the disease, and self-medication can even worsen the problem.
Follow your doctor's instructions. Do not skip medication, physical therapy, follow the prescribed rules of activity and nutrition. If you doubt the correctness of the prescribed treatment, contact another doctor from the same field.
Before a radical change in lifestyle, consult with a specialist. Perhaps you are contraindicated in any sport, or because of an Allergy or stomach disease, some "healthy" product is contraindicated. If you are not sure that you know everything about your body, be sure to consult your doctor.
